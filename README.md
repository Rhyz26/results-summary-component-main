## My process
I first developed this website using HTML, then proceeded to design CSS properties

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to style each element amongst a multitude of elements, 

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

<div class="reaction">
          <p
            style="
              background-color: hsla(0, 100%, 67%, 0.1);
              width: 230px;
              border-radius: 5px;
              margin-bottom: 10px;
              padding: 6px;
            "
          >
            <img src="./assets/images/icon-reaction.svg" class="img-1" /><span
              class="red"
              >Reaction</span
            >
            <span class="red-3">80 <span class="red-1">/ 100</span></span>
          </p>
        </div>
```




### Continued development
I would love to continue learning how to make the website responsive on the small screens
